# Speaker-Embeddings
Implementation of [Generalized End-to-end Loss for Speaker Verification](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.10467.pdf) - GE2E loss, which yields speaker embeddings as results.

This is a mere small project to practice re-producing paper, if you want a repository that actually re-produce the paper, please refer to [Resemblyzer](https://github.com/resemble-ai/Resemblyzer).
